This Repo contains the code used to implement experiments that uses LLMs to perform Arabic Word Sense disambiguation task. 


The repo contains two experiments that uses small language models like mBERT and Large Language models like Llama.
These models are used to address the WSD task as a binary classification and as multichoice tasks.

These models are used in zero-shot learning and fine-tuning
